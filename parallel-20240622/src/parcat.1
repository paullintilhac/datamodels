.SH NAME
parcat \- cat files or fifos in parallel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBparcat\fR [\-\-rm] [\-#] file(s) [\-#] file(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
GNU \fBparcat\fR reads files or fifos in parallel. It writes full lines
so there will be no problem with mixed-half-lines which you risk if
you use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   (cat file1 & cat file2 &) | ...
.Ve
.PP
It is faster than doing:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   parallel \-j0 \-\-lb cat ::: file*
.Ve
.PP
Arguments can be given on the command line or passed in on stdin
(standard input).
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \-\fB#\fR 9
.IX Item "-#"
Arguments following this will be sent to the file descriptor \fB#\fR. E.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  parcat \-1 stdout1 stdout2 \-2 stderr1 stderr2
.Ve
.Sp
will send \fIstdout1\fR and \fIstdout2\fR to stdout (standard output = file
descriptor 1), and send \fIstderr1\fR and \fIstderr2\fR to stderr (standard
error = file descriptor 2).
.IP \-\-rm 9
.IX Item "--rm"
Remove files after opening. As soon as the files are opened, unlink
the files.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
.SS "Simple line buffered output"
.IX Subsection "Simple line buffered output"
\&\fBtraceroute\fR will often print half a line. If run in parallel, two
instances may half-lines of their output. This can be avoided by
saving the output to a fifo and then using \fBparcat\fR to read the two
fifos in parallel:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  mkfifo freenetproject.org.fifo tange.dk.fifo
\&  traceroute freenetproject.org > freenetproject.org.fifo &
\&  traceroute tange.dk > tange.dk.fifo &
\&  parcat \-\-rm *fifo
