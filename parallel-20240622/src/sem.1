.SH NAME
sem \- semaphore for executing shell command lines in parallel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBsem\fR [\-\-fg] [\-\-id <id>] [\-\-semaphoretimeout <secs>] [\-j <num>] [\-\-wait] command
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
GNU \fBsem\fR is an alias for GNU \fBparallel \-\-semaphore\fR.
.PP
GNU \fBsem\fR acts as a counting semaphore. When GNU \fBsem\fR is called
with command it starts the command in the background. When \fInum\fR
number of commands are running in the background, GNU \fBsem\fR waits for
one of these to complete before starting the command.
.PP
GNU \fBsem\fR does not read any arguments to build the command (no \-a,
:::, and ::::). It simply waits for a semaphore to become available
and then runs the command given.
.PP
Before looking at the options you may want to check out the examples
after the list of options. That will give you an idea of what GNU
\&\fBsem\fR is capable of.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP \fIcommand\fR 9
.IX Item "command"
Command to execute. The command may be followed by arguments for the
command.
.IP \fB\-\-bg\fR 9
.IX Item "--bg"
Run command in background thus GNU \fBsem\fR will not wait for
completion of the command before exiting. This is the default.
.Sp
In toilet analogy: GNU \fBsem\fR waits for a toilet to be available,
gives the toilet to a person, and exits immediately.
.Sp

.IP "\fB\-\-jobs\fR \fIN\fR" 9
.IX Item "--jobs N"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fIN\fR" 9
.IX Item "-j N"
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-procs\fR \fIN\fR" 9
.IX Item "--max-procs N"
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fIN\fR" 9
.IX Item "-P N"
.PD
Run up to N commands in parallel. Default is 1 thus acting like a
mutex.
.Sp
In toilet analogy: \fB\-j\fR is the number of toilets.
.IP "\fB\-\-jobs\fR \fI+N\fR" 9
.IX Item "--jobs +N"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fI+N\fR" 9
.IX Item "-j +N"
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-procs\fR \fI+N\fR" 9
.IX Item "--max-procs +N"
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fI+N\fR" 9
.IX Item "-P +N"
.PD
Add N to the number of CPU cores.  Run up to this many jobs in
parallel. For compute intensive jobs \fB\-j\fR +0 is useful as it will run
number-of-cpu-cores jobs simultaneously.
.IP "\fB\-\-jobs\fR \fI\-N\fR" 9
.IX Item "--jobs -N"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fI\-N\fR" 9
.IX Item "-j -N"
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-procs\fR \fI\-N\fR" 9
.IX Item "--max-procs -N"
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fI\-N\fR" 9
.IX Item "-P -N"
.PD
Subtract N from the number of CPU cores.  Run up to this many jobs in
parallel.  If the evaluated number is less than 1 then 1 will be used.
See also \fB\-\-use\-cpus\-instead\-of\-cores\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-jobs\fR \fIN\fR%" 9
.IX Item "--jobs N%"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fIN\fR%" 9
.IX Item "-j N%"
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-procs\fR \fIN\fR%" 9
.IX Item "--max-procs N%"
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fIN\fR%" 9
.IX Item "-P N%"
.PD
Multiply N% with the number of CPU cores.  Run up to this many jobs in
parallel.  If the evaluated number is less than 1 then 1 will be used.
See also \fB\-\-use\-cpus\-instead\-of\-cores\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-jobs\fR \fIprocfile\fR" 9
.IX Item "--jobs procfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fIprocfile\fR" 9
.IX Item "-j procfile"
.IP "\fB\-\-max\-procs\fR \fIprocfile\fR" 9
.IX Item "--max-procs procfile"
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fIprocfile\fR" 9
.IX Item "-P procfile"
.PD
Read parameter from file. Use the content of \fIprocfile\fR as parameter
for \fI\-j\fR. E.g. \fIprocfile\fR could contain the string 100% or +2 or
10.
.IP \fB\-\-pipe\fR 9
.IX Item "--pipe"
Pass stdin (standard input) to \fIcommand\fR.
.Sp
If \fIcommand\fR read from stdin (standard input), use \fB\-\-pipe\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-semaphorename\fR \fIname\fR" 9
.IX Item "--semaphorename name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-id\fR \fIname\fR" 9
.IX Item "--id name"
.PD
Use \fBname\fR as the name of the semaphore. Default is the name of the
controlling tty (output from \fBtty\fR).
.Sp
The default normally works as expected when used interactively, but
when used in a script \fIname\fR should be set. \fI$$\fR or \fImy_task_name\fR
are often a good value.
.Sp
The semaphore is stored in ~/.parallel/semaphores/
.Sp
In toilet analogy the name corresponds to different types of toilets:
e.g. male, female, customer, staff.
.IP \fB\-\-fg\fR 9
.IX Item "--fg"
Do not put command in background.
.Sp
In toilet analogy: GNU \fBsem\fR waits for a toilet to be available,
takes a person to the toilet, waits for the person to finish, and
exits.
.IP "\fB\-\-semaphoretimeout\fR \fIsecs\fR" 9
.IX Item "--semaphoretimeout secs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-st\fR \fIsecs\fR" 9
.IX Item "--st secs"
.PD
If \fIsecs\fR > 0: If the semaphore is not released within \fIsecs\fR
seconds, take it anyway.
.Sp
If \fIsecs\fR < 0: If the semaphore is not released within \fIsecs\fR
seconds, exit.
.Sp
In toilet analogy: \fIsecs\fR > 0: If no toilet becomes available within
\&\fIsecs\fR seconds, pee on the floor. \fIsecs\fR < 0: If no toilet becomes
available within \fIsecs\fR seconds, exit without doing anything.
.IP \fB\-\-wait\fR 9
.IX Item "--wait"
Wait for all commands to complete.
.Sp
In toilet analogy: Wait until all toilets are empty, then exit.
.SH "UNDERSTANDING A SEMAPHORE"
.IX Header "UNDERSTANDING A SEMAPHORE"
Try the following example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  sem \-j 2 \*(Aqsleep 1;echo 1 finished\*(Aq;   echo sem 1 exited
\&  sem \-j 2 \*(Aqsleep 2;echo 2 finished\*(Aq;   echo sem 2 exited
\&  sem \-j 2 \*(Aqsleep 3;echo 3 finished\*(Aq;   echo sem 3 exited
\&  sem \-j 2 \*(Aqsleep 4;echo 4 finished\*(Aq;   echo sem 4 exited
\&  sem \-\-wait; echo sem \-\-wait done
.Ve
.PP
In toilet analogy this uses 2 toilets (\fB\-j 2\fR). GNU \fBsem\fR takes '1'
to a toilet, and exits immediately. While '1' is sleeping, another GNU
\&\fBsem\fR takes '2' to a toilet, and exits immediately.
.PP
While '1' and '2' are sleeping, another GNU \fBsem\fR waits for a free
toilet. When '1' finishes, a toilet becomes available, and this GNU
\&\fBsem\fR stops waiting, and takes '3' to a toilet, and exits
immediately.
.PP
While '2' and '3' are sleeping, another GNU \fBsem\fR waits for a free
toilet.  When '2' finishes, a toilet becomes available, and this GNU
\&\fBsem\fR stops waiting, and takes '4' to a toilet, and exits
immediately.
.PP
Finally another GNU \fBsem\fR waits for all toilets to become free.
.SH "EXAMPLE: Gzipping *.log"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE: Gzipping *.log"
Run one gzip process per CPU core. Block until a CPU core becomes
available.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  for i in *.log ; do
\&    echo $i
\&    sem \-j+0 gzip $i ";" echo done
\&  done
\&  sem \-\-wait
.Ve
.SH "EXAMPLE: Protecting pod2html from itself"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE: Protecting pod2html from itself"
pod2html creates two files: pod2htmd.tmp and pod2htmi.tmp which it
does not clean up. It uses these two files for a short time. But if
you run multiple pod2html in parallel (e.g. in a Makefile with make
\&\-j) there is a risk that two different instances of pod2html will
write to the files at the same time:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  # This may fail due to shared pod2htmd.tmp/pod2htmi.tmp files
\&  foo.html:
\&          pod2html foo.pod \-\-outfile foo.html
\&
\&  bar.html:
\&          pod2html bar.pod \-\-outfile bar.html
\&
\&  $ make \-j foo.html bar.html
.Ve
.PP
You need to protect pod2html from running twice at the same time.
\&\fBsem\fR running as a mutex will make sure only one runs:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  foo.html:
\&          sem \-\-id pod2html pod2html foo.pod \-\-outfile foo.html
\&
\&  bar.html:
\&          sem \-\-id pod2html pod2html bar.pod \-\-outfile bar.html
\&
\&  clean: foo.html bar.html
\&          sem \-\-id pod2html \-\-wait
\&          rm \-f pod2htmd.tmp pod2htmi.tmp
\&
\&  $ make \-j foo.html bar.html clean
